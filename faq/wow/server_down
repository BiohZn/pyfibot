If it is wednesday and between 0500-1200 CET, it's maintenance. The server is supposed to be down. It happens every single wednesday, so get used to it.
If it's not wednesday and you can't connect to the server, it must be down, or the login servers are overloaded. Try again later. And "later" isn't 1 minute, it's 30 minutes or more.
